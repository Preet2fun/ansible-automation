Difference between import and include in ansible

That means import_tasks is importing its tasks file at the very beginning of the playbook. 
But include_tasks include its tasks file when the statement execution happens.
Import tasks pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed but include tasks are processed as they are encountered during the execution of the playbook
