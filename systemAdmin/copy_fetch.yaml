# If you want to copy a file from an Ansible Control Master to remote hosts, the COPY (scp) module would be just fine
# Ansible Fetch is to pull the files from the remote server to the control machine.
# Ansible Synchronize is used to copy the files between remote servers (or) target hosts.  This is more like performing RSYNC with help of Ansible.
# SSH Key based authentication must be enabled between remote hosts:wq!
